## About the project:

This is a little project i made after my OOP teacher asked us to model a Traffic Light for his class. He asked to do it in python, but i think it was going to be cool if i actually do the traffic light using my arduino starter's kit i recently bought. It was really cool to do it.

## How to use it:

The device will have tree buttons, one for choose less, another one for choosing more and an ok button. You need to choose for how many secconds each light will be lit. At this stage, the light you'll be setting will be blinking, after that, you will have to choose what light will be the first one lit. And voi la, the traffic light will function as you set.
